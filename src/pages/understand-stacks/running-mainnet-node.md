## Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through the following steps:

- Download and install the node software
- Run the node
- Mine Stacks token

## Requirements

In order to run a node, some software and hardware requirements need to be considered.

### Hardware

Running a node has no specialized hardware requirements. People were successful at running a node on Raspberry Pis, for instance.
Minimum requirements are moving targets due to the nature of the project and some factors should be considered:

- compiling node sources locally requires computing and storage resources
- as the chain grows, the on-disk state will grow over time

With these considerations in mind, we suggest hardware based on a general-purpose specification, similarly to [GCP E2 machine standard 2](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#general_purpose) or [AWS EC2 t3.large standard](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/):

- 2 vCPUs
- 8 GB memory
- ~50-GB disk (preferably SSDs)

It is also recommended to run the node with a publicly routable IP, that way other peers in the network will be able to connect to it.

-> There is no difference in hardware you need to run a node versus a miner

### Software

If you use Linux, you may need to manually install [`libssl-dev`](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Libssl_API) and other packages. In your command line, run the following to get all packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libssl-dev pkg-config
```

Ensure that you have Rust installed. If you are using macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS, run the following. If you are on a different OS, follow the [official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
```

In case you just installed Rust, you will be prompted to run the following command to make the `cargo` command available:

```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## Step 1: Installing the node

Next, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain.git; cd stacks-blockchain
```

Install the Stacks node by running:

```bash
cargo build --workspace --release --bin stacks-node
# binary will be in target/release/stacks-node
```

To install Stacks node with extra debugging symbols, run:

```bash
cargo build --workspace --bin stacks-node
# binary will be in target/debug/stacks-node
```

-> This process will take a few minutes to complete

## Step 2: Running the node

You're all set to run a node that connects to the mainnet network.

If installed without debugging symbols, run:

```bash
target/release/stacks-node mainnet
```

If installed with debugging symbols, run:

```bash
target/debug/stacks-node mainnet
```

The first time you run this, you'll see some logs indicating that the Rust code is being compiled. Once that's done, you should see some logs that look something like the this:

```bash
INFO [1588108047.585] [src/chainstate/stacks/index/marf.rs:732] First-ever block 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206
```

**Awesome. Your node is now connected to the mainnet network.**

Your node will receive new blocks when they are produced, and you can use the [Stacks Node RPC API](/understand-stacks/stacks-blockchain-api#proxied-stacks-node-rpc-api-endpoints) to send transactions, fetch information for contracts and accounts, and more.

## Running the mainnet node on Windows

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, check that you have the below necessary softwares installed on your PC

- [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

-> **Tip**: While installing the Microsoft Visual Studio Build tools using the above link, select the C++ Build tools option when prompted.

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

#### Optional Dependencies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Download the Binary and run the follower node

-> **Note**: Please make sure to download the new Binary and follow the below steps as and when a [new release build](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/releases/latest) is available.

First, Visit the [Stacks Github releases repo](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/releases/latest). From the various binary list, click to download the Windows binary. Refer the image below.
![BinaryList](/images/mining-windows.png)

Next, click on save file and Press **Ok** in the popup window.
![Windowspopup](/images/mining-windows-popup.png)

Once saved, Extract the binary. Open the command prompt **from the folder where binary is extracted** and execute the below command:

```bash
stacks-node mainnet
# This command will start the mainnet follower node.
```

-> **Note** : While starting the node for the first time, windows defender will pop up with a message to allow access. If so, allow access to run the node.

To execute Stacks node with extra debugging enabled, run:

```bash
set RUST_BACKTRACE=full
set BLOCKSTACK_DEBUG=1
stacks-node mainnet
# This command will execute the binary and start the follower node with debug enabled.
```

The first time you run this, you'll see some logs indicating that the Rust code is being compiled. Once that's done, you should see some logs that look something like the this:

```bash
INFO [1588108047.585] [src/chainstate/stacks/index/marf.rs:732] First-ever block 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206
```

**Awesome. Your node is now connected to the mainnet network.**

## Optional: Running with Docker

Alternatively, you can run the mainnet node with Docker.

-> Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.

-> The ENV VARS `RUST_BACKTRACE` and `BLOCKSTACK_DEBUG` are optional. If removed, debug logs will be disabled

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name stacks_follower \
  --rm \
  -e RUST_BACKTRACE="full" \
  -e BLOCKSTACK_DEBUG="1" \
  -p 20443:20443 \
  -p 20444:20444 \
  blockstack/stacks-blockchain:latest \
/bin/stacks-node mainnet
```

-> The ENV VARS `RUST_BACKTRACE` and `BLOCKSTACK_DEBUG` are optional. If removed, debug logs will be disabled

You can review the node logs with this command:

```bash
docker logs -f stacks_follower
```

## Optional: Running in Kubernetes with Helm

In addition, you're also able to run a mainnet node in a Kubernetes cluster using the [stacks-blockchain Helm chart](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/tree/master/deployment/helm/stacks-blockchain).

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) (Only needed if standing up a local Kubernetes cluster)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` and run the node as a follower:

```bash
minikube start # Only run this if standing up a local Kubernetes cluster
helm repo add blockstack https://charts.blockstack.xyz
helm install my-release blockstack/stacks-blockchain
```

You can review the node logs with this command:

```bash
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=stacks-blockchain
```

For more information on the Helm chart and configuration options, please refer to the [chart's homepage](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/tree/master/deployment/helm/stacks-blockchain).

## Optional: Mining Stacks token

Now that you have a running mainnet node, you can easily set up a miner.
